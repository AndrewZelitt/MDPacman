To start, look at the run_first .ipynb and then run the run_policy_comparison.py file, and finally, the base run.py file

to use the run.py file, the keybinds are 
"s" to run the visual simulator with an MDP
"m" to run a non visual simulator that does a series of runs using the MDP to control pacman based on the slider in the gui.
"spacebar" will allow you to just play normal pacman, though the locations of the ghosts are randomized as well as the number of pellets being just 20 instead of the full board.
